# Cryptography

## Implementations

My most recent crypto suite is [rusty_crypto](https://github.com/SylvanM/rusty_crypto) which uses Speck as its symmetric cipher and Regev encryption for its public key cipher. For the Regev encryption, I am using the parameters reccommended in [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1148). Just for a bit of a disclaimer, these implementations are truly for me to just try implementing something as secure as I can. Please don't use these for anything that needs real security. Although, my goal is eventually to be confident enough in these implementations that I can use them myself!

## Lattice Cryptography

Here is where I just write little explainers to myself to keep the ideas right in my head.
