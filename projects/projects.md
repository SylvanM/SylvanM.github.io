## MatrixKit and NeuralKit

`MatrixKit` and `NeuralKit` are two libraries I developed in tandem with the goal of creating a simple machine learning
library for Swift. Apple has plenty of (more functional) machine learning libraries you can use right from Xcode,
but in my opinion they were not beginner friendly and did not have very intuitive ways to actually craft and train
your own neural network. So, I created my own! Also, I figured that writing a machine learning library from scratch would 
teach me a *lot* more about machine learning than just using other libraries or reading about it. So, `NeuralKit`
does not use *any* external libraries other than `MatrixKit`, which I also wrote. 

`MatrixKit` is an abstract linear algebra library. By "abstract", I mean that you've got this cool `Matrix` type which
has elements that can be
