# Overview
I am an undergraduate studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Cornell University. Though I am still
exploring my interests in these fields, I've always taken a liking to cryptography, and right now I've been studying
post-quantum lattice-based cryptographic schemes. Outside of schoolwork, I am a rock climbing and caving instructor
for Cornell Outdoor Education, and a backpacking trip guide for incoming freshmen students to Cornell.

I've always found that the best way I learn things is when I force myself to explain them to others, which 
is what is going on in the [cryptography](cryptography/crypto.md) section. They are just explainers to myself, 
but if anyone else finds them helpful, awesome!

## Projects
Here is where I'll describe recent projects I've been working on, such as 

 - NeuralKit
 - MatrixKit
 - rusty_crypto
 - OCaml ECC
 - BigNumber

and others! These are all on my github portfolio.

## [Rock Climbing](climbing/CLIMBING.md)
And [here](climbing/CLIMBING.md) is where you can see cool rock climbing stuff
