# Overview
I am an undergraduate studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Cornell University. Though I am still
exploring my interests in these fields, I've always taken a liking to cryptography, and right now I've been studying
post-quantum lattice-based cryptographic schemes. Outside of schoolwork, I am a rock climbing and caving instructor
for Cornell Outdoor Education, and a backpacking trip guide for incoming freshmen students to Cornell.

I've always found that the best way I learn things is when I force myself to explain them to others, which 
is what is going on in the [cryptography](cryptography/crypto.md) section. They are just explainers to myself, 
but if anyone else finds them helpful, awesome!

## Projects
Here are some of the things I've worked on either in the past, or am working on currently! Click on the name of any project to be taken to it.

 - [Clue](https://github.com/SylvanM/Clue): An AI I wrote to play the board game of Clue, which is interesting because it's not a total-knowledge board game. (As in, players do not know all information about the state of the game.)
 - [NeuralKit](https://github.com/SylvanM/NeuralKit): A machine learning library for Swift
 - [MatrixKit](https://github.com/SylvanM/MatrixKit): A fast linear algebra library for Swift
 - [rusty_crypto](https://github.com/SylvanM/rusty_crypto): A post-quantum cryptographic suite written in Rust
 - [Ocaml ECC](https://github.com/SylvanM/cs3110-sectool): Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Helman in OCaml
 - [BigNumber](https://github.com/SylvanM/BigNumber): A performance based big-integer library for Swift

There are many more but these are just some of my favorites.
